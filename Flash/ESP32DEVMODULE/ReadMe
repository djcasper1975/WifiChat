theres a bug when remiving messages no new ones show. this is now fixed but not in this build. hopefully tomorrow.

Files for flashing to device.
I used this and it worked.

dont forget to set the flash adress for each file.
files are named with the correct flash adress so just copy the adress from the filenames.

0x1000WiFiChat.ino.bootloader.bin       0x1000
0x8000WiFiChat.ino.partitions.bin     0x8000
0x10000WiFiChat.ino.bin      0x10000

Please power off and on after flashing.
